trashport/citizens/views.py &mdash; Citizen Role View Layer
======================================================

PURPOSE:
  This file contains all view classes exclusively used by citizen users.
  These views are never called directly from the top-level URL config &mdash;
  they are dispatched to by the role-based system in waste_management/views.py
  or accessed directly through trashport/citizens/urls.py.

HOW THESE VIEWS ARE REACHED:
  1. Citizen visits /dashboard/
  2. DashboardView (waste_management/views.py) sees user.role == CITIZEN
  3. Delegates to CitizenDashboardView defined here
  Same pattern applies to: PickupRequestDetailView, PickupStatusUpdateView,
  ComplaintListView, ComplaintDetailView, PaymentCheckoutView, etc.

CONNECTION MAP:
  - waste_management/views.py       → dispatches most views here
  - waste_management/urls.py        → registers dispatcher URLs
  - trashport/citizens/urls.py      → registers citizen-specific extra URLs
                                      (wallet, redeem coupon, anonymous feedback)
  - waste_management/models.py      → Address, PickupRequest, Complaint, WasteCategory
  - trashport/payments/services.py  → PaymentGatewayService (card/UPI/wallet checkout)
  - trashport/payments/models.py    → PaymentTransaction, WalletHistory
  - trashport/notifications/models.py → Notification (in-app alerts on dashboard)

VIEW INVENTORY:
  CitizenDashboardView         : Main hub &mdash; active pickups, wallet, complaints, history.
  AddressListView              : List all saved addresses.
  AddressCreateView            : Register a new address with GPS map pin.
  AddressUpdateView            : Edit an existing address.
  AddressDeleteView            : Soft-delete (hides address, keeps for history integrity).
  CitizenPickupRequestCreateView : Book a new waste collection with address + category.
  CitizenPickupRequestDetailView : View details of a specific pickup.
  CitizenPickupStatusUpdateView  : Cancel, rate, or initiate payment on a pickup.
  CitizenComplaintListView     : List all complaints filed by this citizen.
  CitizenComplaintCreateView   : File a new complaint against a pickup.
  CitizenComplaintDetailView   : View a single complaint.
  CitizenPaymentCheckoutView   : Multi-method payment checkout (card/UPI/wallet).
  CitizenPaymentSuccessView    : Payment receipt display after successful payment.
  CitizenInvoiceView           : Printable tax invoice for a paid pickup.
  CitizenWalletView            : Recycling points wallet + coupon redemption.
  CitizenRedeemCouponView      : Convert 100 pts → Rs. 10 coupon stored in session.
  CitizenRemoveCouponView      : Cancel active coupon, refund 100 pts.
  SubmitAnonymousFeedbackView  : Accept anonymous feedback (no login required).

WALLET / COUPON FLOW:
  1. Citizen earns points when pickups are COMPLETED (via WalletService.adjust_points
     called in PickupRequest.save()).
  2. Citizen visits CitizenWalletView → sees balance and can redeem coupon.
  3. CitizenRedeemCouponView: deducts 100 pts → stores coupon in request.session.
  4. At CitizenPaymentCheckoutView: reads session coupon → applies Rs. 10 discount.
  5. CitizenRemoveCouponView: removes session coupon → refunds 100 pts.

IMPACT:
  - Changing CitizenPaymentCheckoutView affects the payment UX for ALL citizens.
  - Changing CitizenPickupRequestCreateView.form_valid() affects how pickups are created
    and how GPS coordinates are captured from the map.
  - Changing AddressDeleteView from soft-delete to hard-delete WILL break historical
    pickup records that reference deleted addresses (FK will be NULL).
