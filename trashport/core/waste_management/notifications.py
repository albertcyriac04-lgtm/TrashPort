"""
waste_management/notifications.py — Pickup Lifecycle Notification Dispatcher
=============================================================================

PURPOSE:
  This module contains standalone functions that trigger both in-app notifications
  and email alerts at key moments in the PickupRequest lifecycle.

  These functions are called from inside PickupRequest.save() (waste_management/models.py)
  and from trashport/payments/services.py. They MUST be imported lazily inside
  save() to avoid circular import issues (models.py â†’ notifications.py â†’ models.py).

CONNECTION MAP:
  - waste_management/models.py        â†’ calls functions here on status transitions
  - trashport/payments/services.py    â†’ calls send_payment_completed_notification()
  - trashport/notifications/services.py â†’ NotificationService provides the
                                          create_notification() and send_email_notification()
                                          utility methods used here
  - trashport/notifications/models.py  â†’ Notification model used for in-app records

WHEN EACH FUNCTION IS CALLED:
  send_pickup_requested_notification()   â†’ after PickupRequest.save() on CREATE
  send_pickup_assigned_notification()    â†’ when pickup.collector changes (UPDATE)
  send_pickup_cancelled_notification()   â†’ when status â†’ CANCELLED (UPDATE)
  send_payment_completed_notification()  â†’ after PaymentGatewayService._mark_pickup_paid()

EMAIL TEMPLATES:
  HTML and text templates are expected in:
    trashport/notifications/templates/emails/
      pickup_confirmed.html / .txt
      pickup_assigned.html / .txt
      pickup_cancelled.html / .txt
      payment_receipt.html / .txt

  If a template is missing, NotificationService.send_email_notification()
  falls back to a plain-text fallback (logs a warning).

IMPACT:
  - All functions catch and log exceptions silently — notification failures
    should NEVER cause the calling view to crash or show an error to users.
  - To add a new lifecycle event notification:
      1. Add a new function here.
      2. Call it from PickupRequest.save() in the appropriate transition block.
      3. Create the corresponding email templates.
