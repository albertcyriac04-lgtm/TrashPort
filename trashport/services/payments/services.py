trashport/payments/services.py — Payment Gateway and Wallet Service Layer
==========================================================================

PURPOSE:
  This module provides all payment processing logic for TrashPort. It acts as
  the intermediary between the view layer (citizens/views.py) and the payment
  data models (payments/models.py).

  All three payment methods (Card, UPI, Wallet) go through this layer —
  never directly through the view. This ensures consistent audit trail creation,
  wallet point deduction logic, and pickup status transitions.

CONNECTION MAP:
  - trashport/citizens/views.py       â†’ CitizenPaymentCheckoutView calls
                                        process_card_payment(), process_upi_payment(),
                                        process_wallet_payment()
  - trashport/payments/models.py      â†’ Creates PaymentTransaction and WalletHistory records
  - waste_management/models.py        â†’ PickupRequest (marks is_paid, updates status to PENDING)
  - waste_management/notifications.py â†’ send_payment_completed_notification()
                                        (called from _mark_pickup_paid)

DUMMY / SIMULATED GATEWAY:
  This is a SIMULATED payment gateway — no real money changes hands.
  Specific test card numbers produce specific outcomes (success or decline).
  UPI payments always succeed for any syntactically valid UPI ID.
  Wallet payments succeed if the user has enough points.

  DUMMY_CARDS catalog (defined at module top):
    "4242424242424242" â†’ Always succeeds (Visa)
    "5555555555554444" â†’ Always succeeds (Mastercard)
    "4000000000000002" â†’ card_declined
    "4000000000009995" â†’ insufficient_funds
    "4000000000000069" â†’ expired_card
    "4000000000000127" â†’ incorrect_cvc

POINTS-TO-INR CONVERSION:
  POINTS_TO_INR_RATE = Rs. 0.10 per point
  100 points = Rs. 10 discount

FLOW FOR EACH PAYMENT METHOD:
  1. process_card_payment()  â†’ Validates card vs DUMMY_CARDS â†’ creates transaction â†’ _mark_pickup_paid()
  2. process_upi_payment()   â†’ Validates UPI ID regex format â†’ creates transaction â†’ _mark_pickup_paid()
  3. process_wallet_payment()â†’ Calculates required points â†’ deducts via WalletService â†’ _mark_pickup_paid()

  _mark_pickup_paid() (shared helper):
    • Sets pickup.is_paid = True and pickup.status = PENDING
    • Saves pickup to DB
    • Sends payment receipt notification + email (with invoice link)

RETURN FORMAT (all methods return a dict):
  Success: {"success": True, "transaction_id": ..., "amount": ..., "method": ..., ...}
  Failure: {"success": False, "error_code": ..., "error_message": ...}

IMPACT:
  - All public methods use @db_transaction.atomic — if anything fails mid-payment,
    the entire transaction (DB writes) is rolled back.
  - Changing POINTS_TO_INR_RATE affects all wallet redemptions immediately.
  - Changing _mark_pickup_paid() affects how all payment methods finalize a pickup.

        Shared helper called by all three payment methods on success.

        WHAT IT DOES:
          1. Sets pickup.is_paid = True
          2. Sets pickup.status = PENDING (enters the collector job queue)
          3. Saves both fields to DB
          4. Resolves the invoice URL for the notification email
          5. Calls send_payment_completed_notification() to:
               - Create in-app payment notification
               - Send HTML payment receipt email to citizen

        IMPACT:
          - After this runs, the pickup is visible to collectors as PENDING.
          - The invoice URL uses 'waste_management:payment_invoice' — if the URL
            name changes in urls.py, update this reverse() call.
          - Exception in notification is caught and logged; does NOT fail the payment.

        CONNECTION:
          - waste_management/models.py  â†’ PickupRequest.StatusChoices (PENDING)
          - waste_management/notifications.py â†’ send_payment_completed_notification()
