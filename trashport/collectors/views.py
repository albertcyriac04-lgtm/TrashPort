trashport/collectors/views.py &mdash; Collector Role View Layer
===========================================================

PURPOSE:
  This file contains all view classes exclusively used by collectors (waste
  collection staff). These are never called directly from URLs &mdash; they are
  dispatched to by the role-based system in waste_management/views.py.

HOW THESE VIEWS ARE REACHED:
  1. Collector visits /dashboard/ (registered in waste_management/urls.py)
  2. DashboardView (waste_management/views.py) sees user.role == COLLECTOR
  3. Delegates to CollectorDashboardView defined here

  Same pattern applies to: PickupRequestDetailView, PickupStatusUpdateView

CONNECTION MAP:
  - waste_management/views.py       → dispatches to CollectorDashboardView,
                                       CollectorPickupRequestDetailView,
                                       CollectorPickupStatusUpdateView
  - waste_management/models.py      → PickupRequest, CollectorPayoutSetting
  - trashport/collectors/models.py  → CollectorAadhaarProfile (for Aadhaar sync)
  - trashport/maps/models.py        → CollectorLocation (GPS position for map)
  - trashport/maps/services.py      → GeoService.haversine_distance() (distance calc)
  - trashport/payments/models.py    → UPIPayoutRequest (payout history)
  - waste_management/urls.py        → /wallet/redeem-upi/ → CollectorRedeemUPIView

COLLECTOR WORKFLOW:
  1. Collector opens dashboard → sees pending pickups sorted by distance
  2. Collector "claims" a pickup → PickupRequest.collector = user, status = ASSIGNED
  3. Collector drives to location → clicks "Mark In Transit" → status = IN_TRANSIT
  4. Collector arrives, weighs waste → submits actual weight → status = COMPLETED
     • If actual > estimated: extra_fee = excess × fee_per_kg × 2 (2x surcharge)
     • Collector earnings = base_min + (distance × rate_per_km) + (extra_fee × commission%)
     • Collector wallet_balance is credited immediately on COMPLETED
  5. Collector can release a claimed pickup → status = PENDING (no penalty)

AADHAAR VERIFICATION GATE:
  Collectors MUST be verified (user.is_verified = True) to claim or complete pickups.
  _sync_aadhaar_status() checks the CollectorAadhaarProfile and syncs the
  user.is_verified / user.verification_status fields if they are out of sync.

  If an Aadhaar profile exists and aadhaar_verified = True, but user.is_verified
  is still False (can happen if admin flag was reset), this auto-corrects it.

IMPACT:
  - Changing the claim logic in CollectorPickupStatusUpdateView.post() affects
    how collectors take on jobs.
  - Changing completion logic affects when wallet_balance is credited.
  - Changing _get_unassigned_pickup_data() affects which jobs appear on the map.
